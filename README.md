Week 05 – Hosting SPA With DevOps
 

This week we’ll be looking at effective ways to host Single Page Applications (SPA) and some battle-tested architecture to support their functionality. Traditionally web apps have been deployed as one monolith application. Due to increasing demands for web rich experiences that must perform and scale for high traffic volume, new solutions and common methods have been developed to ensure that products are reliably engineered to ensure stability.

 

After looking at alternate hosting solutions for SPA’s, we’ll also examine why SPA’s are dominating the web along with the benefits and advantages of deploying one. In a world with an ever-increasing demand for optimally performant applications, one crucial piece of knowledge is a sound foundational understanding of why architectural decisions are made and how these applications can be used for rapid deployment.

 

In our lab, we’ll be taking a look at our SPA that’s going to need hosting. We’ll also look at some common pipeline sequences that are triggered on deployment to ensure that our application is properly tested, along with the automation of static code analyses.
